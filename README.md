Responsive CSS3 Library

Most Repsonsive CSS libraries supply components which have behaviors already coded.
Such as a 3 column layout that will become a 3 row layout on a small screen.
EPResponsive (Elijah Pepin Responsive) offers a different approach. 

EPResponsive supplies all the classes necessary to adjust an element based on screen size.
Yet it allows you to apply each class as you see fit.
This puts the power of creativity and functionality in the hands of the desiger/coder.
